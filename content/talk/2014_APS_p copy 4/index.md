summary:
abstract: "*Phytophthora capsici* is a devastating oomycete that affects solanaceous, cucurbitaceous, fabaceous and other crops in the United States (US) and worldwide. Research on the genetic structure of this pathogen has increased in recent decades; however, such studies have used limited markers due to the absence of genomic resources for *P. capsici*. The recent release of the *P. capsici* genome allows for design of whole-genome markers for genetic studies.  Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been a preferred marker due to their co-dominant nature and high polymorphism. Identifying SSRs associated with transcript sequences is of interest since they constitute annotated markers with a predicted function. In this study, we used an in silico approach to identify SSRs in *P. capsici* whole-genome transcript sequences and to design primers for genetic analyses. Using the MIcroSAtellite identification tool (MISA), the total number of 1â€“6 bp perfect SSRs detected in *P. capsici* transcript sequences (19,805) represented 9.36% (1,855 SSRs) of the transcripts. Identified SSRs mainly included trinucleotide repeats, of which repeat motif AAG was the most abundant (7.92%).  Primers were designed for detected SSRs; a subset was evaluated in a diverse set of *P. capsici* isolates, and several were found to be polymorphic. The identified SSRs improve the current resources of molecular markers for this pathogen, which will facilitate *P. capsici* genetic studies in the US."
