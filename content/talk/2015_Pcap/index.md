summary:
abstract: "*Phytophthora capsici* is a devastating oomycete that affects solanaceous, cucurbitaceous, fabaceous, and other crops in the United States (US) and worldwide. The release of the *P. capsici* genome allows for design of robust markers for genetic studies. We surveyed and characterized simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in the *P. capsici* transcriptome using an in silico approach. Identifying SSRs associated with transcript sequences is of interest since they constitute annotated markers with a predicted function. SSRs are also desirable markers due to their high polymorphism and transferability across species. A total of 1,855 SSRs were identified, representing 9.36% of the total number of sequences examined. Trinucleotide repeats were the most abundant and accounted for 71% of all repeats. A total of 1,620 primer pairs were successfully designed to amplify the SSRs. A subset of SSR primers was evaluated in a diverse set of *P. capsici* isolates, and fragment analysis revealed variations in the repeats of 20 SSR primers. *P. capsici* isolates from North Carolina were also evaluated for virulence, fungicide resistance, and mating type. The identified SSRs will facilitate the genetic characterization of *P. capsici* populations, which may assist in deployment of disease management strategies. "
