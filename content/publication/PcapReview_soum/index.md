abstract: "In 1922, *Phytophthora capsici* was described by Leon Hatching Leonian as a new pathogen infecting pepper (*Capsicum annuum* L.), with disease symptoms of root rot, stem and fruit blight, seed rot, and plant wilting and death. Extensive research has been conducted on P. capsici over the last 100 years. This review succinctly describes the salient mile markers of research on *P. capsici* with current perspectives on the pathogenâ€™s distribution, economic importance, epidemiology, genetics and genomics, fungicide resistance, host susceptibility, pathogenicity mechanisms, and management."
