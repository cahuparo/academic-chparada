abstract: "*Phytophthora capsici* epidemics are propelled by warm temperatures and wet conditions. With temperatures and inland flooding in many locations worldwide expected to rise as a result of global climate change, understanding of population structure can help to inform management of *P. capsici* in the field and prevent devastating epidemics. Thus, we investigated the effect of host crop, geographical origin, fungicide sensitivity, and mating type on shaping the population structure of *P. capsici* in the eastern U.S. Our fungicide in vitro assays identified the emergence of insensitive isolates for fluopicolide and mefenoxam. A set of 12 microsatellite markers proved informative to assign 157 *P. capsici* isolates to five distinct genetic clusters. Implementation of Bayesian structure, population differentiation, genetic diversity statistics, and index of association analysis, allowed us to identify population structure by host with some correspondence with genetic clusters for cucumber and squash isolates. We found weak population structure by state for geographically close isolates. In this study, we discovered that North Carolina populations stratify by fluopicolide sensitivity with insensitive isolates experiencing nonrandom mating. Our findings highlight the need for careful monitoring of local field populations, improve selection of relevant isolates for breeding efforts, and hypervigilant surveillance of resistance to different fungicides."
