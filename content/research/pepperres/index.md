*Phytophthora capsici* causes crown, root, and fruit rot as well as foliar lesions in peppers. We conducted field trials in 2015 and 2016 to evaluate 32 commercial and experimental pepper cultivars against a mixed-isolate inoculum in North Carolina. Cultivars Martha-R and Meeting were classified as highly resistant to *P. capsici*.

Greenhouse experiments were also conducted to determine the response of 48 pepper cultivars when inoculated individually with two isolates from North Carolina and an isolate from Michigan. *Phytophthora capsici* isolates exhibited different levels of virulence in pepper cultivars screened for resistance. Landraces CM334 and Fidel as well as the cultivars Martha-R, Meeting, and Intruder were categorized as highly resistant or resistant to the three isolates tested.

Today, host resistance remains a promising management strategy to control *P. capsici* in pepper, and our study highlighted the importance of accounting for pathogen diversity when screening for resistance.
