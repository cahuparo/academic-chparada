Here, we examine cytological changes at different developmental stages using X-ray computed tomography. We hypothesize that the storage root cambium cells act as a barrier during *C. fimbriata* infection.

The computed tomography scan suggests that the Jumbo storage root cambium serves as a barrier for *C. fimbriata* inner colonization. This high-density region is underdeveloped in the Canner storage root. Our proof of concept experiment potentially highlights the presence of abundant perithecia in Canner roots that are absent in Jumbo roots.
