The [PathogenSurveillance pipeline](https://nf-co.re/pathogensurveillance/latest) is a scalable, modular tool designed for pathogen monitoring. My work involves contributing to new features, enhancing user experience, and benchmarking the pipeline across high-performance computing environments.

With improved functionality and performance, the pipeline is a valuable asset for genomic epidemiology and biosurveillance in agriculture and public health.
