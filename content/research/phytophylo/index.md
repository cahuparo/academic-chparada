------

This project involves sequencing and annotating over 100 *Phytophthora* genomes to explore their phylogenomic relationships and diversity within this important genus. We focus on assembling high-quality genomes using long-read ONT data and ensuring robust annotations through collaborative efforts among postdoctoral researchers.

The data generated here will serve as a resource for understanding evolutionary patterns, population dynamics, and the mechanisms driving pathogenicity in *Phytophthora* species.
