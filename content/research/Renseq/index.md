## **What is the sweetpotato catalog of NLR genes?** 

------

Plants and pathogens exist in a continuum coevolutionary struggle for survival. Over evolutionary time, plants evolved a complex and multilayered immune system to defend from pathogens and communicate with beneficial organisms. Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins constitute one of the largest and most studied family of plant resistance proteins. The main goal of this research project is to generate a catalog of NLR genes in the hexaploid sweetpotato. We are applying target sequence capture combined with long read DNA sequencing technology, a technique known as RenSeq, to answer this question. The outcomes of this project will help accelerate breeding efforts for emergent pathogens of sweetpotato. As agriculture moves towards lower input and sustainable practices under a changing climate, it becomes critical to strategize potential scenarios where pathogens spread into new areas or re-emerge more aggressively. A resistance gene repertoire represents an adaptable management tool to develop climate resilient crops.
