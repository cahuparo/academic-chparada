I am a translational plant pathologist leveraging advanced genomic tools and field research to address critical agricultural challenges. My research is anchored in creating actionable solutions for growers by linking molecular insights with practical applications. As a postdoctoral scholar at Oregon State University, I focus on developing diagnostic tools, studying pathogen population genomics, and investigating pathogen genomics. Currently, I am co-leading projects to validate CRISPR-based diagnostics for field pathogen detection and contributing to a large-scale effort to sequence and annotate over 100 *Phytophthora* genomes. These initiatives aim to improve disease monitoring and management strategies in diverse agricultural systems. Outside of research, I am passionate about science communication and mentoring. My goal is to inspire the next generation of scientists while advancing sustainable and effective disease management practices.
