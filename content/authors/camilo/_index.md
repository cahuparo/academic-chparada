I am a PhD student in Plant Pathology at NC State University. My research in plant pathology spans pathogen population biology to plant and fungal genomics. I am passionate about translational science and trained in extension. I am currently working on identifying the complete set of intracellular plant immune receptors known as NLR genes in sweetpotato.
